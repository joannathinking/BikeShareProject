# BikeShareProject
This project is the capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. 

The project is to answer key business questions by using data analytic skills for Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.

I will use Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. Motivate International Inc. has made the data available under this [license.](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)
